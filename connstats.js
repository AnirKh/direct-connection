  Everything the UI derives from an RTCStatsReport, as pure functions of it.

  Extracted because the reading was wrong for a long time and nothing could
  see it: the old code scanned every local-candidate and kept whichever came
  last, so with more than one route it named a candidate that was not carrying
  traffic. A browser and two peers were needed to notice. Here a plain Map
  stands in for the report and the answer can simply be asserted.

  Nothing in this file touches the DOM or any module state — pass the report in,
  get the answer back.

  Two things here feed the shield's panel and are not about quality at all:
  which addresses the two devices are showing each other, and a coarse
  description of a device. They live here because they are derived facts of the
  same kind — and the second because what a peer says about its device is
  untrusted, and the list of what may be displayed should sit next to the code
  that displays it.
