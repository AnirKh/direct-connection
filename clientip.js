  Direct Connection — clientip.js
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────

  Works out which address a request really came from. Every rate limit in
  server.js keys on this, so if it can be forged then none of them hold: the
  PIN lockout, the room-creation cap and — with no second line of defence —
  the email endpoint.

  X-Forwarded-For is a chain that grows left to right. Each proxy APPENDS the
  address it received the connection from, so the rightmost entries were
  written by the proxies nearest us and anything further left was supplied by
  the client and can say whatever it likes.

  Reading the leftmost entry therefore reads attacker-controlled input. We
  count in from the right instead, by however many proxies we actually sit
  behind.

    TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=1  (default)  one proxy in front — Render, Fly, Heroku,
                                     nginx. Uses the last entry in the chain.
    TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=0             no proxy: ignore the header entirely and
                                     use the TCP peer. Set this if the process
                                     is exposed directly, or clients can forge
                                     their identity by sending the header.
    TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=n             n proxies you control, counted from us
                                     outwards.
