  Direct Connection — ratelimit.js
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────

  The sliding-window counters behind the `list-sessions` and `create-session`
  limits, kept here for the same reason clientip.js is separate: they are small,
  pure, and the thing several limits rest on, so they are worth testing directly
  rather than through a running server.

  Shape of the state: Map<clientIp, number[]> — a list of request timestamps.

  joinVerdict is here as well: which of the join limits apply to which kind of
  credential is a decision about rate limiting, and it was wrong for a while in
  a way only a table of cases shows.

/**

 * The two locks exist to slow down guessing a 6-digit PIN. The invite token is
 * 192 random bits; nobody guesses it, so nobody presenting the right one is
 * guessing. Holding them to the PIN's locks protected nothing and cost a lot:
 * room names are public, so fifteen wrong PINs from anyone locked the invited
 * guest out of a room they held a valid link to — and could be repeated for as
 * long as the room existed.
 *
 * So a correct token goes straight through, and everything else meets the
 * locks first. A PIN counts for nothing while a lock is on, right or wrong: if
 * a correct one were admitted during the lock, the lock would stop nothing —
 * the guesser would just keep going until one landed.
 *
 * Wrong PINs can still lock a room against other PIN joiners. That is what a
 * guess limit on a short code costs, and the invite link is the way round it.
