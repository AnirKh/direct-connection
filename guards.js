  The safety decisions, as pure functions.

  Every one of these had a real bug behind it, and every one was invisible to
  the test suite because it lived inside DOM-driven code in app.js:

    mayCaptureForCall     a peer could send call-offer, or later call-accept,
                          cold and open the camera with no prompt shown
    consentedVideo        answering a voice call with withVideo:true turned the
                          camera on
    mayRenderText         plaintext arriving on the data channel was displayed,
                          which undid failing closed on a key mismatch
    mayDeliverRecording   a voice note recorded in one room was delivered to the
                          next room's peer
    shouldRetryAutoJoin   an invite-link join whose answer never arrived left
                          the lobby disabled behind "Joining…" forever
    mayHandleFrame        only chat text was checked for encryption; a file
                          announcement or a call request arriving in the clear
                          was acted on, even after the channel had been declared
                          unsafe
    mayStartRecording     a double-click opened the microphone twice and the app
                          kept track of one — the other stayed on until the tab
                          closed
    mayKeepMicOpen        the room could go away while the microphone was still
                          opening, leaving it live in the lobby
    mayApplyRoomEvent     "the other side left" named no room, so one room
                          expiring tore down the chat in another

  One is here without a bug behind it, because it is the thing users are asked
  to trust:

    shieldState           what the shield in the chat header says — nothing
                          yet, encrypted but unchecked, or verified

  Extracting them is the point: a rule that can be called with plain values can
  be tested for every combination, including the ones nobody thinks to try.
  app.js keeps the effects — opening the camera, drawing bubbles — and asks
  here whether it is allowed to.

  No DOM, no module state, no side effects.
