  Stamps the client with a build id, so a browser can never run files from two
  different versions without noticing.

    node tools/sync-build.js            restamp if any client file has changed
    node tools/sync-build.js --check    report a stale stamp and exit 1, changing nothing

  WHY THIS EXISTS

  index.html used to load every script as `app.js?v=202608261800` — a stamp
  that was written once and never changed. GitHub Pages lets a browser keep each
  file for ten minutes, each on its own clock, so after an update a browser
  could hold a new page and an old script, or the reverse. Both were reproduced:

    new page + old script   the new button is on screen and does nothing
    old page + new script   the script looks for an element that is not there,
                            throws while loading, and the whole app is dead

  The stamp is the fix for the first: it changes whenever any client file
  changes, so a new page asks for addresses no browser has cached. The second
  is caught by app.js itself, which compares the stamp it was loaded with
  against the one written into it — see "Is this script running in the page
  that was built with it?" at the top of app.js.

  THE ID

      202610131742-3fa9c1d2
      └─ when ──────┘ └─ what ─┘

  "what" is a hash of every client file, so --check can tell whether the stamp
  still describes the files without knowing when it was made. "when" is there
  so two ids can be put in order: the server announces its id, and a page that
  finds itself older than the server knows to fetch the new one.

  The id lives in two places and this tool is the only thing that writes
  either: `const APP_BUILD` in app.js, and `?v=` on each local file index.html
  loads. server.js reads it out of app.js when it starts.
