## Content-Security-Policy

The policy is defined once, in **`csp.js`**. It reaches the browser two ways and both are needed:

- `server.js` sends it as a response header (Render deployment; also the only form that can carry `frame-ancestors`)
- `index.html` carries a `<meta>` copy, because GitHub Pages serves static files and cannot set headers

After editing `csp.js`, regenerate the meta tag:

```
npm run sync-csp
```

`npm run check-csp` reports drift and exits non-zero without changing anything — worth running before a deploy, since a stale meta tag only affects the static build and the Render deployment will look fine. The server also warns on startup if the two have drifted.

## Server configuration (Render or self-hosted)

Set **`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`** to a comma-separated list of every **browser origin** that loads the app and talks to this API (WebSocket + `fetch`). Examples:

- Static site on GitHub Pages: `https://YOURNAME.github.io`
- App and API on Render: `https://direct-connection.onrender.com`
- Local dev: `http://localhost:3000`, `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

If an origin is missing, the browser will block CORS and **WebSocket connections will be rejected** during the upgrade (except non-production loopback without an `Origin` header).

Optional:

- **`PUBLIC_SESSION_LIST=0`** — the lobby never receives other users’ room names (only empty lists). Hosts still share PIN or invite link as usual.
- **`RESEND_API_KEY`**, **`MAIL_TO`** — required for “leave a message” email; `POST /api/send-message` also requires a custom header (`X-DC-Client: 1`) sent by the bundled client so drive-by form posts cannot abuse the endpoint.
- **`HEARTBEAT_MS`** — how often the server pings each WebSocket client, in ms (default **30000**, accepted range 1000–300000). A client that misses a sweep is dropped, which frees its room and tells the other peer. Lower it only for testing; every client answers every sweep, so short intervals mean constant traffic.
- **`LEAVE_ATTACH_MAX_BYTES`** — optional max attachment size for the main-page email form (default **28 MB**). Resend rejects emails over **~40 MB** total after encoding, so do not set this above **35 MB** unless you use another mail provider.
