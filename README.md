## Server configuration (Render or self-hosted)

Set **`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`** to a comma-separated list of every **browser origin** that loads the app and talks to this API (WebSocket + `fetch`). Examples:

- Static site on GitHub Pages: `https://YOURNAME.github.io`
- App and API on Render: `https://direct-connection.onrender.com`
- Local dev: `http://localhost:3000`, `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

If an origin is missing, the browser will block CORS and **WebSocket connections will be rejected** during the upgrade (except non-production loopback without an `Origin` header).

Optional:

- **`PUBLIC_SESSION_LIST=0`** — the lobby never receives other users’ room names (only empty lists). Hosts still share PIN or invite link as usual.
- **`RESEND_API_KEY`**, **`MAIL_TO`** — required for “leave a message” email; `POST /api/send-message` also requires a custom header (`X-DC-Client: 1`) sent by the bundled client so drive-by form posts cannot abuse the endpoint.
