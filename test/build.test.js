/*
  Tests for the build stamp — what stops a browser running files from two
  different versions.

  The bug it answers was reported as "the new button does nothing, and the
  other person cannot get in". Three mix-ups produced it, all reproduced:

    new page + old script   the button is on screen, with nothing behind it
    old page + new script   the script throws while loading; the whole app is dead
    a tab left open         still runs the old code against the new server, and
                            asks for a PIN the room does not have

  The first is prevented by the stamp, the second by app.js checking the stamp
  it was loaded with, the third by the server announcing its build. The first
  two are tested here; the third's decision is in guards.test.js.

  The first test below is the one that bites in day-to-day work: change any
  client file without restamping and it fails, here and in the pre-commit hook.
